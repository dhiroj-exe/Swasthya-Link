Many people die approx 12,000/weak due to delayed in getting beds and bloods and some pedestrian die due delayed in getting ambulance because ambulance get the details of the patient in late and many more. So, for solving these problems we're come with an web-based application which help user to overcome this problem. 

Features of our application :
1) Easily find all neaby hospitals.
2) Easily find all nearby blood banks.
3) Easily see how many beds are vacant in each wards in each hospital.
4) Our website change all the data when it get the user's location means it dynamic all the contents. So,user don't need to enter his location or other information they can directly see their nearby blood banks, vacnet beds, etc...
5) What if some is living in rural area and far from city and in the midnight if someone fall ill(generally senior citizens) then person definitely gets panic and maybe not getting the proper care which  become a cause of death?--> So, for solving this we create an emergency features which auto detects the user's location and only user need to fill their basic details with image(optional) and audio(optional) and that form is forwarded to those organisations who provide ambulance or maybe some NGOs then after verification they'll assign the ambulance to them because some time in these types of organisations calls of patients become high which results many people not getting the ambulance facilities at right time.
6) Besides, we create an AI assistant which help patients by providing some temporary solution which help to reduce the chances of deaths. This AI trained with highly qualified doctors so there's negligible chance of giving inappropriate solutions.
7) Besides, user can connect with doctors to get the temporary solutions if our AI assistent not able to give the exact answer which you needed.
8) In future, we'll connect this with IoT to early detection of symptoms of any health related problems which alert patient and their loving one and book the ambulance automatically if there's more sensitive case.
9) Besides, we have video section where user can see for what type of problem you need to do what type of excercise which maintains the life of the user and we save somebody's life.

Note : Right now, everything is static not dynamic because this project takes time due some sensitive features of this application but soon it'll available to you.
